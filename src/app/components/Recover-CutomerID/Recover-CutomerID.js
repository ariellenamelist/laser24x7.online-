            How to Recover Your Forgotten Laser247 Customer ID?
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a result, you can't remember your Laser247 customer ID. Don't you think that's annoying? It's not that difficult to get it back, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Hereâ€™s what you have to do:</b>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Contact Laser247 customer service by using WhatsApp. On the Laser247.online website, you can click the WhatsApp button directly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easily enter <b>"My Laser247 Login ID is gone."</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              When a support staff member contacts you, they will ask for your full name and the WhatsApp number you used to register.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our customer service team will email you information within five minutes without requiring any verification if you contact us using the same WhatsApp phone that you used to create your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              They will email your customer ID to the registered mobile number or via WhatsApp as soon as they verify that it is you.
            </li>
          </ol>
