        <b>Withdrawing Funds</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Will you be cashing out? Before you can start your withdrawal, you must have at least ₹100 in your Laser247 account. In this way, funds are deposited into your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> In the upper right corner, select your Customer ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> Select Withdrawal from the menu now.

      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> You must input your bank information and your UPI ID or IFSC number if this is your first time.

      </p>
      <p>
        Note: - Even though Laser247 offers several payout options, UPI is by far the fastest. Withdrawals made using UPI typically take effect in five minutes. It may also take up to four hours if you have selected a bank transfer.
